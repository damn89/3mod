  <h2>1998</h2>

  <p>
An architectural design competition to design a contemporary arts museum in Helsinki was held in 1992. The competition was meant for architects from the Nordic and Baltic countries. Five internationally renowned architects participated among whom there was only one US citizen. In 1993 the work Chiasma by the American architect Steven Holl was selected from the 516 competitors. The construction of the disputed[by whom?] and controversial[citation needed] Kiasma started in 1996. The museum opened in May 1998.[1]

The museum attracted 160,000–180,000 visitors per year in 2011–2013.[2]

Kiasma was closed for repairs in September 2014 and reopened in the Spring 2015.[1]
