  <p>
The Longaberger Company is an American manufacturer and distributor of handcrafted maple wood baskets and other home and lifestyle products. It was one of the primary employers in the area near Dresden, Ohio with more than 8,200 employees until 2003 when it was forced to start laying off employees. There are currently 340 full-time and part-time employees. Seventy of those still make baskets. Started in Dresden, the company is now headquartered in Newark, Ohio. A family-owned and operated business, the Longaberger Company was started by Dave Longaberger in 1973, and is currently led by John Rochon Jr. who is a CVSL director and son of the CVSL chairman. A combination of bad economic times and changing tastes in home decor combined to send sales, which peaked in 2000 at $1 billion, to about $100 million in 2012.[1] Several rounds of layoffs have occurred.
