    The Ridderzaal (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɪdərzaːl]; English: Hall of Knights)[1] is the main building of the 13th century Binnenhof in The Hague, Netherlands. It is used for the state opening of Parliament on Prinsjesdag, when the Dutch monarch drives to Parliament in the Golden Coach and delivers the speech from the throne. It is also used for official royal receptions, and interparliamentary conferences.
