  <h1>Tzistarakis Mosque</h1>
  <h2>1759</h2>

  <p>
 The mosque was built in 1759 by the Ottoman governor (voevoda) of Athens, Mustapha Agha Tzistarakis. According to tradition, Tzistarakis used one of the pillars of the Temple of Olympian Zeus to make lime for the building, although it is more likely that he used one of the columns of the nearby Hadrian's Library. This act led to his dismissal as the Turks considered it a sacrilege which would cause vengeful spirits to be loosened upon the city, a superstition confirmed when there was an outbreak of the plague later in the year
